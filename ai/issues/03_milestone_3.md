## Objective

Enable users to map gestures to actions and configure advanced modes like Keyboard Cycling.

## Description

This milestone extends the Configurator's capabilities to include the "Gesture Mapping UI," the "Keyboard Mode Editor," and the "HUD Settings." This is a critical step in making the device configurable and user-friendly.

-   [ ] Unmapped gestures are clearly marked as "NoOp" or equivalent.
-   [ ] The "Keyboard Mode Editor" is implemented.
-   [ ] Users can configure gesture cycling groups, including the order of keys/actions.
-   [ ] Users can set the timeout duration for keyboard cycling.
-   [ ] Users can define a "commit" gesture and a "cancel" gesture.
-   [ ] The "HUD Settings" section is implemented.
-   [ ] Users can enable or disable the HUD.
-   [ ] Users can adjust the scale of the HUD (e.g., from 80% to 150%).
-   [ ] Users can set an auto-hide delay for the HUD.
-   [ ] A "Show only on input" option is available.
-   [ ] A debug mode toggle is available to show unmapped gestures in the HUD.
